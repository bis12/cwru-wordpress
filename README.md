In here we will put instructions on how to get this working.

Let's leave notes so we don't have to do it from scratch...

- Navigation Menu should be created, or just use the hierarchy of pages if desired
- Dependency: WP-Cycle, Image dimensions should be set at 1000x285
- wp-cas with ldap plugin is needed which requires php curl to be installed
